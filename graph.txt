Graph  -> collection of vertex(node) and edges(path) 
 
1) non linear data structure 
2) it contains vertices and edges. 

G(V,E)  V->Vertices E->Edges 
G(V)={S,N,CG,U,M}
G(E)={(S,U),(S,M),(S,N),(U,CG), (M,CG),(N,CG)}


1) directed graph | diagraph -> edges -> direction -> arrow 
2) undirected graph -> edges -> does not have any direction 
3) NullGraph -> if a graph does not have any edges than its known as null graph.
4) connected graph -> no node is isolated. 
5) complete graph -> each node is connected with all node 

goole map 
source -> A 
destination -> B 


1) array 
2) linkedlist
